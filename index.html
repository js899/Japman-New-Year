                Japman Bhaji,<br><br>
                I know we had an argument last night. I lost my cool for no reason over nothing.  
                Me saying that you'll always be a brother to me doesn't matter because I don't know if I'll be able to prove it.  
                Coming year, we don't know if we'll be seeing each other at all.  
                So I wanted to take a moment to thank you for the support and friend you've been to me ever since, and sorry for the times I'd hurt you.  
                Fights may still keep happening 😂, just don't get me wrong 🥹.  
                I'd love to always think that you're by my side, and I assure you that I'll always be by your side.<br><br>
                With 💌,<br>
                Jaideep<br><br>
                And Happy New Year!  
                May Guru Sahib bless you and our friendship! 💛
