                Japman Bhaji,<br><br>
                I know we had an argument last night. I lost my cool for no reason over nothing. Me saying that you'll always be a brother to me doesn't matter because I don't know if I'll be able to prove it. Coming year, we don't know if we'll be seeing each other at all. So I wanted to take a moment to thank you for the support and friend you've been to me ever since, and sorry for the times I'd hurt you. Fights may still keep happeningðŸ˜‚, just don't get me wrongðŸ¥¹. I'd love to always think that you're by my side and I assure you that I'll always be by your side.<br><br>
                With ðŸ’Œ,<br>
                Jaideep<br>
                And Happy New Year!<br>
                May Guru Sahib bless you and our friendship!
